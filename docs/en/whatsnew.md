# What's New (v1.0.0-rc29 -> v1.8.33)

This page summarises the most notable changes since the
v1.0.0-rc29 release. For the full commit-by-commit history see
the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/OpenADS/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

---

## v1.8.33 Highlights

### Fixed: Legacy `AdsCreateIndex` path resolution

The legacy `AdsCreateIndex` wrapper (used by Harbour's `INDEX ON ... TO`)
did not resolve index paths the same way as `AdsCreateIndex61`:

- Empty bag name → did not create structural CDX
- Relative paths → not resolved against table directory
- Missing extension → fell through to NTX creation

This caused Harbour's `INDEX ON field TO filename` to fail. The fix
mirrors `AdsCreateIndex61`'s path resolution logic.

### Create-Index Path Tests

8 new test cases covering various index path forms: no extension,
with extension, absolute paths, empty bag, subdirectory, backslash,
legacy wrapper, and create+reopen round-trip.

---

## v1.8.32 Highlights

### Comprehensive Lock Test Coverage

New test suite with **23 test cases** covering previously untested lock API
surfaces. Key findings documented:

| API | Behavior |
|-----|----------|
| `AdsGetNumLocks` | Counts **record locks only** — table locks not included |
| `AdsTestRecLocks` | No-op diagnostic — always returns 0 regardless of state |
| `AdsIsTableLocked` | Reflects `AdsLockTable` only — exclusive open not reported |
| Re-entrant lock | 2x `AdsLockRecord` on same recno requires 2x `AdsUnlockRecord` |

### Remote Lock Contention Tests (Pritpal Bedi scenarios)

6 new tests reproducing multi-instance lock scenarios over TCP:
- Record lock contention fails cleanly (does not hang)
- Write without lock returns error 5035 (GoHot guard)
- FLock contention resolves within retry window
- FLock allows writes without per-record lock
- Exclusive open allows writes (remote mode)
- Append auto-lock works over wire

---

## v1.8.31 Highlights

### Write-Guard (GoHot) Enforcement

Implements Harbour's `hb_dbfGoHot()` equivalent at the engine level.
In **Shared** mode, callers must hold either a Record Lock (`AdsLockRecord`)
or File Lock (`AdsLockTable`) before mutating a record. This prevents
silent data corruption when multiple connections share a table.

- **Engine guard** in `writeback_record_()`: checks lock state before every
  write. Returns error 5035 (`AE_LOCK_FAILED`) if no lock is held.
- **Pending-append exemption**: freshly-appended records (via `AdsAppendRecord`)
  are writable without explicit LockRecord — standard xBase/ACE semantics.
- **Exclusive mode bypass**: opens in `ADS_EXCLUSIVE` mode grant unrestricted
  access without locks.

### Wire Protocol — OpenTable Mode Pass-Through

The client now sends the requested open mode (Shared/Exclusive/Read) to the
server in the `OpenTable` payload, using a new capability bit
(`kCapOpenTableMode = 0x00000008`). Old servers ignore the prefix; new
servers read it and open in the correct mode.

This fixes remote `ADS_EXCLUSIVE` opens which previously were always opened
as `ADS_SHARED` on the server.

### Server-Side Table Identity Fix

`LockRecord`/`UnlockRecord`/`LockTable`/`UnlockTable` now route directly to
the engine table from `tbls_[id]` instead of through the ABI handle. This
fixes a critical bug where `ensure_abi_handle()` opened a second Table
instance, causing locks registered on one Table to be invisible to writes
on the other.

### RI Cascade/SETNULL Locking

Referential Integrity enforcement now locks child tables before
cascade/SETNULL writes, so the GoHot gate permits the internal mutations.

### Other Fixes

- `AdsOpenIndex` resolves index paths against the connection data directory
  (not just the table dir) for subdirectory-qualified paths.

---

## v1.8.30 Highlights

### Fix: multi-user record count staleness

When multiple instances/connections share a table, `Browse()` and
`LastRec()` showed only the records visible at open time. Records
appended by other connections were invisible.

**Root cause:** Three layers of caching that were never invalidated
by external writes:

1. `AdsGetRecordCount` cached the record count on first call and
   served stale data forever (only cleared on local writes).
2. `AdsRefreshRecord` only cleared `row_valid`, not `rec_count_cached`.
3. The server's `GetRecordCount` handler returned a stale in-memory
   value without re-reading the DBF header from disk.

**Fix:**

- `AdsRefreshRecord` now clears `rec_count_cached` for remote tables,
  forcing a fresh `GetRecordCount` round-trip.
- Server `GetRecordCount` handler re-reads the DBF header from disk.
- New `IDriver::refresh_record_count_from_disk()` virtual method for
  all drivers (CDX, ADT, NTX, Cached).

**Impact:** 30 concurrent instances each appending records now all
see every record after repositioning (GoTop / GoBottom / Browse).

---

## v1.8.29 Highlights

### CDX index seek: 1,000x+ faster GOTO with active order

The `seek_key` function used a **linear scan** through decoded branch
pages — O(N) per seek, degenerating to O(N²) for a full traversal of
20,000+ records.  Replaced with a proper **B-tree descent**: at each
internal node, binary-search the branch keys to find the correct child
pointer, then descend.  The leaf search is also now binary (O(log M)).

Benchmark on 50,000 keys (key_size=20):

| Operation             | Before       | After     | Speedup  |
|-----------------------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Sequential seek_key   | 4,149 µs     | 3.2 µs    | **1,294x** |
| Random seek_key       | 4,215 µs     | 3.6 µs    | **1,162x** |
| Soft seek (miss)      | 8,318 µs     | 2.4 µs    | **3,518x** |

This fixes the extremely slow GOTO reported by Tim Stone: 47 seconds
for 20,000 records with an active CDX order.

---

## v1.8.21 Highlights

### Server prints version on launch

`openads_serverd` includes the build version in the startup banner
and in the error-log â€œserver startedâ€ entry (same string as
`--version`).

---

## v1.8.20 Highlights

### Studio HTTP in Windows packages + rddads DD props

Windows release builds ship `openads_serverd` with **`OPENADS_WITH_HTTP=ON`**,
so `--http-port 6263` enables Studio at `http://localhost:6263`.

`ace.h` now defines SAP DD properties **121â€“130**, including
`ADS_DD_DISABLE_DLL_CACHING` (125) required by Harbour rddads.

---

## v1.8.19 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” scope + SET DELETED ON: no more xBrowse ghost rows

`OrdKeyCount` counted deleted keys inside an index scope while
navigation skipped them. FiveWin xBrowse then showed blank/skipped
rows and could refuse to close. Key counts now match the live
scoped walk. Update **client DLL and** `openads_serverd`.

---

## v1.8.18 Highlights

### Server filesystem API (`oads_*` / `Ads*`)

Clients can manage files and directories **under the server data root**
without a mapped drive â€” LetoDB-style helpers with OpenADS names.

| Capability | ACE functions |
|---|---|
| Exists / erase / rename | [`AdsCheckExistence`](../functions/ads-check-existence/), [`AdsDeleteFile`](../functions/ads-delete-file/), [`AdsRenameFile`](../functions/ads-rename-file/) |
| Size / time / date | [`AdsGetFileSize`](../functions/ads-get-file-size/), [`AdsGetFileTime`](../functions/ads-get-file-time/), [`AdsGetFileDate`](../functions/ads-get-file-date/) |
| List / directories | [`AdsDirectory`](../functions/ads-directory/), [`AdsDirExist`](../functions/ads-dir-exist/), [`AdsDirMake`](../functions/ads-dir-make/), [`AdsDirRemove`](../functions/ads-dir-remove/) |
| Low-level I/O | [`AdsFOpen`](../functions/ads-fopen/) Â· [`AdsFCreate`](../functions/ads-fcreate/) Â· [`AdsFClose`](../functions/ads-fclose/) Â· [`AdsFRead`](../functions/ads-fread/) Â· [`AdsFWrite`](../functions/ads-fwrite/) Â· [`AdsFSeek`](../functions/ads-fseek/) |

**Security:** remote ops require `EnableFileFunc=1` in `openads.ini` or
`--enable-file-func` on `openads_serverd` (default **off**). Paths are
jailed under `--data` / the connection data directory.

Full guide: [Server filesystem](../server-filesystem/). Harbour notes:
`examples/harbour/oads_fs/`. Update **both** client DLL and
`openads_serverd`.

### Also in 1.8.18

Binaries for Windows x64 and x86 are attached to the
[v1.8.18 GitHub release](https://github.com/FiveTechSoft/OpenADS/releases/tag/v1.8.18).

---

## v1.8.17 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” `DbCreate` / `AdsCreateTable` no longer writes next to the app

When connected with `AdsConnect60(tcp://â€¦)`, create still wrote the
table on the **client** cwd; the post-create open was remote and
failed with **ADSCDX/5103**. Create/drop now go over the wire;
tables land under the server data directory. Update **both**
`openace64.dll` / `ace32.dll` and `openads_serverd`.

---

## v1.8.14 Highlights

### SQL â€” result cursor no longer starts at a phantom empty row

`AdsExecuteSQLDirect` / `AdsExecuteSQL` left the result cursor
*before* the first row, where SAP ADS positions it *on* the first
row â€” so reading the current record right after executing returned
a phantom empty row on every query. The result now lands on row 1,
matching SAP, for engine tables, `system.*`/aggregate results,
SQL-backend cursors and remote clients alike. Callers that already
issue `AdsGotoTop` first are unaffected.

### REMOTE â€” backward (PgUp) read-ahead

Read-ahead was forward-only: a `Skip(-1)` browse paid one round-trip
per row. Reverse scans now prefetch too â€” a 300-row reverse scan
dropped from 299 wire requests to 7 â€” and a new capability bit keeps
mixed old/new client-server pairs correct in both directions.

### The server's real version is now visible from the client

Repeated "the fix didn't help" reports keep resolving to an old
`openads_serverd` still running (a live Windows service holds its
exe open, so copying an update over it can fail silently) â€” and
there was no way to prove it from the client side: the wire
handshake and `AdsMgGetInstallInfo` both answered hardcoded strings.
Now the handshake carries the real build version
(`openads/1.8.14`), and `AdsMgGetInstallInfo` on a **remote**
management handle reports the **server's** version â€” against any
server ever shipped (old builds identify themselves as `0.3.2`).
From Harbour: `AdsMgConnect("host:port")`,
`AdsMgGetInstallInfo()[3]`, `AdsMgDisconnect()`.

### REMOTE â€” `CloseTable` kept the table files open on the server

Closing a remote table released the client's view of it, but the
server-side "shadow" handle (used for ordered navigation, scopes and
locks) stayed open until the session disconnected â€” so erasing,
renaming or reopening the just-closed `.dbf`/`.cdx`/`.fpt` in
exclusive mode failed with "file in use", and app-level retry loops
turned that into seconds of delay or an apparent hang at
close-all-files time. `CloseTable` now closes the shadow handle with
the table.

Update `openads_serverd` for the CloseTable fix; update
`openace64.dll` too to see the server's version from the client. New
example: `examples/fivewin/xbpaint_delscope.prg` (logs the server
version, then drives the exact xBrowse repaint shape â€” page reads,
`AdsGetRelKeyPos`/`AdsSetRelKeyPos`, scrollbar drags â€” over a remote
scoped table with `SET DELETED ON`).

---

## v1.8.13 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” ordered/scoped browses: correctness + read-ahead

Wraps up the `SET DELETED` remote work: flipping `AdsShowDeleted`
now invalidates the client's read-ahead block (deleted rows no
longer linger mid-scan), relations read the parent key from the
client's current row instead of the server's lagging cursor, and
`Seek`/`SetIndexOrder`/`GetRecord` no longer serve stale prefetched
rows. Read-ahead is now active on **ordered** browses too (a 299-row
ordered scan dropped from 598 wire round-trips to 7), `AdsCacheRecords`
is honoured, and `GotoTop`/`Seek` return the landed row so the first
read after a reposition is free.

Update **both** `openads_serverd` and `openace64.dll` â€” several of
these fixes are client-side. New example:
`examples/fivewin/xbrowse_delscope.prg` (FWH xBrowse, remote,
`SET DELETED ON` + index scope, deletions inside the scope).

---

## v1.8.12 Highlights

### ENGINE â€” multi-record `Skip` over deleted rows

Follow-up to v1.8.10/v1.8.11: with the deleted-row filter active, a
remote natural-order browse could show a **duplicate of the previous
row** where a deleted record used to appear, or end the walk a few
rows early. `Table::skip` computed multi-record skips with physical
record arithmetic; it now counts **visible** rows, matching the
index-order path and Clipper `SKIP n` semantics. Also fixes LOCAL
`dbSkip(n > 1)` over deleted/filtered rows.

Requires updated `openads_serverd` (and `openace64.dll` for LOCAL
mode). Regression tests: three M12.33 cases in
`abi_remote_index_nav_test.cpp`.

---

## v1.8.11 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” `SET DELETED ON` before connect

Follow-up to v1.8.10: the flag now also reaches the server when
`SET DELETED ON` runs **before** `AdsConnect60` â€” the order every
rddads / FiveWin app uses. The client syncs the state right after
connecting, and the server re-applies it to the lazily-created ABI
connection used for ordered/scoped navigation.

Requires updated `openace64.dll` **and** `openads_serverd`. Regression
tests: `remote scoped walk honours SET DELETED ON issued before
connect` (+ `â€¦ before first ordered op`) in
`abi_remote_index_nav_test.cpp`; wire probe
`tools/remote_deleted_probe.cpp`.

---

## v1.8.10 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” `SET DELETED ON` on scoped walks

`AdsShowDeleted(0)` (SET DELETED ON) now propagates to the server over
the wire (`ShowDeleted` 0xDA/0xDB). Scoped index navigation
(`OrdScope` / `AdsSetScope` + `GotoTop`/`Skip`) no longer returns rows
flagged deleted on remote aliases while LOCAL mode already hid them.

Requires updated `openace64.dll` **and** `openads_serverd`. Regression
test: `remote AdsSetScope with SET DELETED ON skips deleted rows` in
`abi_remote_index_nav_test.cpp`.

---

## v1.8.1 Highlights

### ABI â€” `OrdScope` string key padding

Harbour passes scope strings at trimmed length, but CDX keys are
space-padded. `setScopeTop` / `setScopeBottom` on a character work-order
field (top == bottom) could land `GotoTop` at EOF on **local and remote**.
`AdsSetScope` now pads to index `key_length`. Test: `QA-D` in
`abi_qa_repro_test.cpp`.

---

## v1.8.0 Highlights

### CDX â€” NTXPL852 / PL852 OEM collation

`AdsSetCollation` accepts `NTXPL852` and `PL852` for Polish CP-852 index
sorting. Å (0x9D) sorts between L and M on CDX build, seek, insert, and
reindex â€” matching Harbour / Clipper local-server behaviour.

### CDX â€” bulk `REINDEX`

`Table::reindex()` for CDX tags uses the same bottom-up `build_bulk()`
path as `CREATE INDEX`, replacing the slow erase-then-insert walk.

### Tests

19 new unit tests cover engine collation weights, CDX driver bulk sort,
and ABI soft/hard seek + index walk.

---

## v1.7.0 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” `AdsSetScope` / `OrdScope` navigation

`OrdScope` top/bottom bounds were sent to the server but `GotoTop`/`Skip`
ignored them â€” scoped walks returned every record in the table. Fixed by
marking the parent table in `ordered_tables_` after `SetScope`, and by
always syncing `SetOrder` before remote index navigation.

Requires updated `openace64.dll` **and** `openads_serverd`. Regression
tests in `abi_remote_index_nav_test`; harness `openads_remote_scope_probe`.

### Docs â€” CDX rollback warning

[Migrating from ADS](migrating-from-ads/) now warns that CDX files written
by OpenADS use Harbour's `RCHB` header and are unreadable by SAP ACE
(error 7017). Back up SAP-built `.cdx` before migration if rollback is
possible.

---

## v1.6.5 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” `OrdKeyCount()` + `AdsGetDate()` fixes

- **`OrdKeyCount()` returned 0** on remote aliases â€” xBrowse grids showed
  no rows. New `GetKeyCount` wire opcode (0xB0/0xB1) computes the true
  filtered key count from the active index order.
- **`AdsGetDate()` crashed** on remote `ADS_DATE` columns when rddads
  passed a `RemoteIndex` handle. Resolves to parent `RemoteTable` before
  field I/O.

---

## v1.6.4 Highlights

### REMOTE â€” FiveWin TDataBase / ADSRDD fixes (Dates + unlocked writes)

- Date columns (`ADS_DATE`) no longer crash `FieldGet` / `AdsGetJulian` in
  remote mode (safe ordinal resolution + row cache + server `YYYYMMDD`
  normalisation).
- `FieldPut` / `AdsSet*` on an unlocked record now returns
  `AE_RECORD_NOT_LOCKED` (5035) instead of AV â€” the "probe lock by write"
  idiom works and produces the expected `EG_UNLOCKED`.
- All remote Get/Set paths hardened against field ordinals passed as small
  pointers; repeated `FieldGet` and post-open/EOF cases are stable.
- `AdsGetAllLocks` no longer 5000-crashes on remote handles.
- Server lock forwarding and post-`Append` write handling improved.

See CHANGELOG for full details. Requires updated `openace64.dll` +
`openads_serverd`.

## v1.6.3 Highlights

### REMOTE / FWH â€” xBrowse over `tcp://`

Fixes Harbour `ADSCDX` + FWH `xBrowse` / `TDataBase` with production CDX
tags (`OrdSetFocus`, e.g. `CUSTNAME`):

- **`AdsKeyNo` / scrollbar** â€” logical key position (`1..n`) instead of
  physical `RecNo`; `AdsGetRelKeyPos` / `AdsSetRelKeyPos` for remote
  indexed tables.
- **Bookmark `DbGoto` after paint** â€” server syncs the ABI index cursor
  on `GotoRecord` so rows no longer shift on every `Refresh`.
- **GoUp at top** â€” `AdsAtBOF` reports BOF after `Skip(-1)` at key #1;
  stops the first-row rubber-band repeat.

Requires **both** `openace64.dll` (client) and an updated
`openads_serverd` (GotoRecord ABI sync). Regression tests in
`abi_remote_index_nav_test`.

---

## v1.6.2 Highlights

### Production CDX tag names & append-row `FieldGet`

SAP/BCC compound CDX tag names (`CUSTNAME`, not `AME`); blank
`AdsGetField` at BOF/EOF for FWH `td_blankrow()`.

---

## v1.5.1 Highlights

### Security & remote hardening

Path jail on remote `Connect`, coherent nested `LockMgr` unlock, TLS
verification by default, and remote routing for memo/Unicode/date/raw
field writes.

### Harbour smoke CI

Windows GitHub Actions job plus `run_harbour_smoke.ps1` /
`bootstrap_harbour_ci.ps1` for end-to-end Harbour + ACE ABI validation.

### Remote ABI (Fase 2)

`AdsSetRelation`, `AdsSetRecord` / `AdsGetRecord`, and `AdsCustomizeAOF`
over `tcp://`. Local `AdsAggregate` / `AdsFetchWhere` on in-process DBF
tables.

### Plus â€” SQLite & MSSQL navigational write

SQLite and native MS SQL Server (TDS) backends now support
`AdsAppendRecord`, `AdsSetString`, `AdsWriteRecord`, and
`AdsDeleteRecord` â€” parity with MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Firebird, and ODBC.
MSSQL `ADS_STRING` fields are padded to declared width on read.

### Engine

Committed ADT/ADI fixtures for CI; VFP `0x32` header (autoinc + nullable
columns together).

---

## v1.5.0 Highlights

### SQL Backend â€” Transaction Management (SQLRDD Pattern)

New `BackendTxManager` provides nested transaction support for SQL
backends: BEGIN/COMMIT with SAVEPOINT emulation at nesting > 1,
auto-commit after N DML statements (configurable), and dirty-flag
tracking. Available on SQLite and PostgreSQL via `BackendTableOps`
vtable (`begin_tx`/`commit_tx`/`rollback_tx`/`set_auto_commit`).

### SQL Backend â€” Lazy Column Loading with Learning

`BackendFieldOptimizer` tracks which columns are actually read per
table. After 5 unique single-column fetches, it automatically
switches to `SELECT *` â€” avoiding repeated demand-fetches for
tables where many columns are eventually needed.

### SQL Backend â€” Restrictor Composition

`BackendWhereBuilder` combines For clause, user filter, scope
bounds, index restrictions, AOF predicates, and recno filters into
a single AND-ed WHERE clause. Handles exact seek (collapses to `=`)
and range seek.

### SQL Push-Down â€” 50+ New Translatable Functions

The `try_emit_sql_where()` emitter now translates STR, VAL, DTOS,
DTOC, CTOD, ROUND, CEILING, MOD, EXP, LOG, SQRT, SIGN, PADR/PADL/PADC,
STRTRAN, LEFT, RIGHT, AT/ATNUM, IIF, IF, NIL, ISNULL, ISBLANK, EMPTY,
LEN, YEAR, MONTH, DAY, HOUR, MINUTE, SECOND, DOW, CDOW, CMONTH, NOW,
and more into portable SQL. The `$` contains operator now supports
field-to-field (`field1 $ field2 â†’ field2 LIKE '%' || field1 || '%'`).

### UNION / UNION ALL

The SQL parser handles `SELECT ... UNION [ALL] SELECT ...` with any
nesting depth. Each UNION member carries its own WHERE, ORDER BY,
LIMIT, and aliases.

### DDL Parsing

New `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`, `DROP INDEX` statement parsers with
support for IF EXISTS, quoted identifiers, and column definitions.
Ready for backend execution hooks.

### AOF Expression â€” LIKE and IS NULL

The AOF expression layer now supports `LIKE '%pattern%'` with `%`/`_`
wildcards, and `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL` unary operators.

---

## New Features

### SQLite-backed Table Driver

An optional SQLite-backed table driver is now available behind
the `OPENADS_WITH_SQLITE` CMake flag. When enabled, the engine
can open and manipulate tables through a SQLite backend, providing
an alternative storage layer. New source files:

- `src/sql_backend/sqlite_backend.cpp`
- `src/sql_backend/sqlite_connection.cpp`
- `src/sql_backend/sqlite_table.h`
- `src/sql_backend/sqlite_index.h`

### SQL Backends â€” PostgreSQL / MariaDB / ODBC (OpenADS Plus)

OpenADS can now open tables on **PostgreSQL**, **MariaDB / MySQL**
and any **ODBC**-reachable engine behind the ACE ABI, selected by
the connection URI (`postgresql://` / `mariadb://` / `odbc://`),
exactly like the SQLite backend. From the application's point of
view the table behaves like any other work area â€” navigation,
field read, and column SEEK all work.

These four SQL backends sit behind a single **pluggable
backend-ops registry**: each registers one `BackendTableOps`
struct (17 function pointers mirroring the table ops) so the ~17
ABI navigation / field functions stay backend-agnostic instead of
multiplying a per-backend `if` block across each. Adding another
backend (e.g. Firebird, or MSSQL / Oracle via ODBC) is one ops
struct plus one registration line. The native local DBF / ADT and
the `tcp://` remote paths are unchanged fall-throughs. Identifiers
are validated to safe ASCII and SEEK values use prepared-statement
parameters (no string concatenation). See `docs/OPENADS_PLUS.md`.

### ADT Validation Patches (F1â€“F7, R1â€“R3)

ADT table validation now includes a full set of structural
patches (F1â€“F7) and record-level checks (R1â€“R3), strengthening
the integrity guarantees for `.adt` files produced by SAP
Advantage.

### Native ADT/ADI Create, Read, Write, and Index Seek

OpenADS can now operate end-to-end on native `.adt` / `.adi` /
`.adm` files:

- **Create** â€” `AdsCreateTable(ADS_ADT)` writes a valid table
  header, field descriptors, and an optional `.adm` memo store.
- **Write** â€” `AdsAppendRecord` / `AdsWriteRecord` persist rows
  and memo payloads.
- **Read** â€” Re-open, field get, record count, memo round-trip.
- **Index** â€” `AdsCreateIndex61` builds `.adi` bags (first tag
  via `AdiIndex::create`, additional tags via `add_tag`).
- **Seek** â€” `AdsSeek` on character and numeric ADI keys.
- **AUTOINC** â€” counter seeded from existing rows at open time;
  descriptor tail bytes 139â€“143 stay zero on disk.
- **ADM memo layout** â€” 8-byte blocks with a 1024-byte metadata
  prefix.

### ADI Write Path

The ADI index driver now supports write operations â€” `insert`,
`erase`, and `flush` â€” including dense-leaf recno decoding and
character-key seek. This completes the read-write cycle for ADI
indexes.

### Trigger Dispatch (BEFORE / INSTEAD_OF / AFTER)

Triggers now fire with proper timing dispatch:

- **BEFORE** â€” runs before the DML statement.
- **INSTEAD_OF** â€” replaces the DML on views.
- **AFTER** â€” runs after successful execution.

Priority sort, `__error` table for failures,
`sp_DisableTriggers` / `sp_EnableTriggers` stored procedures,
and composite trigger keys in `system.triggers` are all
supported.

### DA-Web Management UI

The browser-based Data Architect replacement (**DA-Web**) has
received extensive work:

- **Inline cell editing** with dirty tracking and visual
  feedback.
- **Index management** â€” save and delete indexes via API.
- **Trigger CRUD** â€” add, delete, and edit triggers with
  splitter and inline validation.
- **AOF (Rushmore) filter toolbar** in the table browser.
- **ADS SQL syntax highlighting** with HeidiSQL-like colours.
- **Stored procedure / function source viewer** with parameter
  grid and Save-to-DD.
- **Index tag browser**, field type labels, and SQL scripts.
- **Connection menu** â€” New DD, Open DD, Free Tables.
- **Effective Permissions** and **Members** tabs on user/group
  panels.
- **RI tag dropdowns** populated from binary `.add` files.

### openmonitor â€” TUI and Web Dashboard

A new `openmonitor` tool provides both a terminal UI (TUI) and a
web dashboard for monitoring and administering `openads_serverd`.

### OpenADS Studio â€” Responsive (phone / tablet)

The Studio web console now adapts to small screens â€” usable from a
phone or tablet, not just a desktop browser. Below ~768 px the
table-list sidebar becomes a slide-in **drawer** (â˜° in the header,
dimmed backdrop, auto-close on select); the tab bar scrolls
horizontally and forms / modals reflow to a single column with
larger touch targets. A long-standing dark-theme bug â€” the
`--panel` / `--panel-2` / `--border` CSS variables were
self-referential, so panels and borders rendered transparent â€” is
fixed as part of this work.

### Remote Scan Performance (sequential prefetch)

A forward scan over the `tcp://` wire used to cost roughly one TCP
round-trip per record (`Skip` + `AtEOF` + `IsFound`). A
sequential-prefetch path (negotiated via a Connect capability flag)
now piggybacks a lookahead block of rows onto forward-`Skip` acks;
the client serves them locally and folds the consumed count back
into the next wire step so the server cursor never desyncs.
`AdsAtEOF` / `AdsAtBOF` are answered from the cached current row and
`AdsIsFound` from a cached `Found()` flag. Result: a 50k-record
loopback scan is **~3.9Ã— faster** (NAV-only) / **~3.3Ã—** (3-field
read), with `IsFound` round-trips dropping to zero. The change is
additive and backward-compatible â€” old clients (no capability
advertised) keep the previous wire behaviour byte-for-byte.

### PHP Native Extension (`php_openads`)

A native Zend PHP extension (`php_openads.dll`) is now available
for PHP 8.x, providing full DD CRUD (35 new `AdsDictionary`
methods), date/timestamp field decoding, and per-statement field
name caching.

### SAP Data Dictionary Import Improvements

- `import_dd` now copies `.am` memo files and decodes encrypted
  function bodies.
- Group membership import (DB:Admin, DB:Backup, DB:Debug) from
  binary `.add` files.
- Trigger timing captured from `system.triggers`.
- `grant_permission` and `AE_SAP_PERMS_NEED_IMPORT` error code
  for permission migration.

### WAL Crash Recovery

WAL (Write-Ahead Log) crash recovery now handles `APPEND`
records, completing the ARIES-lite recovery model.

### DD SQL Expansion

- `CREATE DATABASE`, `GRANT` / `REVOKE`.
- `sp_*` stored procedures.
- `system.*` virtual tables (`system.iota`, `system.columns`).
- `AdsDDGet/SetFieldProperty`, triggers, stored procedures,
  views, and index properties.
- Per-table access control with user/group permission levels.

### Server-Side Aggregation (Tier-3)

`AdsAggregate` now supports `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and
`MAX` push-down to SQL backends (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MariaDB,
ODBC). The aggregate spec is validated before execution, and
results are served through a handle-based result set
(`AdsAggregateCount` / `AdsAggregateValue` /
`AdsAggregateClose`).

### FetchWhere V2

`AdsFetchWhere` now serves forward scans from a cached result
set â€” no per-match `goto_record` round-trip. The client
receives rows in bulk and walks them locally, with optional
per-row recno (`WANT_RECNO` flag). Non-AOF `SET FILTER` bulk
scans are routed through `AdsFetchWhere` for significant
throughput gains.

### ODBC Driver (slice 1â€“3)

A full ODBC driver (`openads_odbc.dll`) is now available:

- **SELECT round-trip** with scrollable cursors
  (`SQLFetchScroll`).
- **Typed column access** â€” `SQLDescribeCol` /
  `SQLColAttribute` / `SQLGetData` dispatch through the
  backend ops vtable.
- **Positional parameter binding** via `SQLBindParameter`.
- **Catalog functions** â€” `SQLPrimaryKeys` /
  `system.primarykeys`.
- **App-lock emulation** â€” `rLock()`/`fLock()` via SQL Server
  `sp_getapplock`, PostgreSQL advisory locks, MariaDB named
  locks, and Firebird `OPENADS$LOCKS` table.

### Native Write Path (PostgreSQL / MariaDB / Firebird)

`AdsAppendRecord` / `AdsSetField` / `AdsWriteRecord` /
`AdsDeleteRecord` now work end-to-end on PostgreSQL, MariaDB,
and Firebird backends â€” no ODBC passthrough required.

### SQL Push-Down Expansion

`SET FILTER` and AOF expressions are now pushed down to SQLite
and PostgreSQL as `WHERE` clauses when the expression tree is
within the optimisable subset (`try_emit_sql_where`). Coverage
includes `$` (contains), `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, `SUBSTR()`, and
`UPPER()`.

### Complete API Documentation (Portuguese)

All **364 ACE functions** are now documented in Portuguese
(pt-BR) under `docs/pt/funcoes/`, covering syntax, parameters,
return values, and examples.

### x86 (32-bit) Calling Convention Fix

`ENTRYPOINT` is now `__stdcall` (WINAPI) on Win32, matching
Harbour's `rddads` calling convention. This fixes stack
corruption when 32-bit Harbour apps call ACE functions through
the DLL. The x86 `.def` file and import library are updated
to match. (Reported by Jonsson / RusSoft Ltda.)

### CI â€” msvc-x86 Build Leg

A new `msvc-x86` matrix entry in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
ensures 32-bit builds are tested on every PR, catching
x86-only breakage (bitness-dependent narrowing, `SQLLEN*`
signature mismatches, `/WX` warnings) before they reach main.

## Bug Fixes

### Engine

- **CDX tag order** â€” `list_tags()` now sorts by tag-header
  offset (creation order) instead of alphabetical leaf order.
  Fixes `DBSETORDER(n)` selecting the wrong tag on CDX bags
  written by SAP ADS or BCC Harbour. (Reported by Jonsson /
  RusSoft Ltda.)
- **CDX expression-index key size** â€” composite expression
  keys (e.g. `UPPER(cName)`) are now sized from the expression's
  natural fixed-width length, not the first record's content
  length. The old rtrim truncated keys, causing rows out of
  order after reindex on large tables. (Reported by Jonsson /
  RusSoft Ltda.)
- **CDX empty-leaf walk** â€” forward and backward index walks now
  skip empty leaves left behind by `erase()`. Fixes REINDEX /
  bulk-delete `ADSCDX/5000`. (PR #63)
- **CDX leaf recno bits** â€” `compute_layout` sizes the
  record-number field from `max_rec`, not just key length, so
  wide-key tags no longer truncate recnos â‰¥ 4096. (PR #62)
- **CDX prefix seek** â€” `seek_key` compares only the search-key
  length, so partial seeks like `SEEK "ART-00024800"` match stored
  `"ART-00024800 desc ..."` keys. (PR #62)
- **Conditional FOR on logical fields** â€” the index expression
  evaluator now treats logical fields as numeric (0/1) instead of
  truthy strings, so `FOR ACTIVE` correctly filters `.F.` records.
  (PR #121)
- **INDEX ON corruption** â€” prevent `INDEX ON` from corrupting
  source table indexes. (PR #118)
- **MSSQL backward SKIP** â€” off-by-one: `abs_n == pos` now reaches
  row 0 instead of reporting BOF. (PR #65)
- **ABI typed getters for SQL backends** â€” `AdsGetDouble`/`Long`/`
  LongLong`/`String` dispatch through the backend ops vtable, so
  PostgreSQL returns real values. (PR #66)
- **`AdsGetIndexHandle` for SQL backends** â€” resolves by-name for
  PG tables so indexed seek works end-to-end. (PR #66)
- **NTX numeric key format** â€” numeric fields indexed into an NTX
  bag now store keys in the native DBFNTX form (zero-padded
  magnitude + complemented negatives) instead of space-padded
  `STR()` text. A native xBase reader's `dbSeek(<number>)` now
  matches the on-disk key. Reopened index bags retain the numeric
  encoding. (PR #67)
- **Numeric `dbSeek`** â€” rddads sends `ADS_STRING` key type for
  numeric seeks; the engine now handles this correctly.
- **`ALIAS->FIELD` in numeric seek** â€” strip `ALIAS->` prefix so
  aliased CDX tags find keys.
- **Transaction rollback** â€” physically removes appended records
  on rollback instead of leaving ghost rows.
- **LockMgr held-state leak** â€” `held_` is now cleared on unlock
  so the next lock takes a real OS lock.
- **`AdsGetRecordCount`** â€” now respects `bFilterOption`.
- **`AdsSetRelation`** â€” fails honestly when appropriate.
- **`seek_key`** â€” `walk_to_last` now honours `SET DELETED ON`.
- **Empty table navigation** â€” correctly handles tables with zero
  records.
- **Deleted-record navigation** â€” proper state after skip past
  deleted rows.
- **LockMgr lock refcount** â€” repeated locks on the same key are
  now refcounted; the OS lock is released only when the final
  holder unlocks.
- **WAL record bounds checks** â€” `TxLog::read_all` validates each
  UPDATE/APPEND field length before reading, so truncated or
  corrupt WAL files no longer over-read.

### ABI

- **Out-of-bounds read** in numeric key formatting â€” prevented.
- **Swapped option bits** â€” `ADS_DESCENDING` (0x02) and
  `ADS_COMPOUND` (0x08) were decoded incorrectly in
  `AdsCreateIndex61`.
- **Case-insensitive field-name resolution** â€” `field_index` is
  now cached for performance.
- **`AE_NO_CURRENT_RECORD`** â€” returns 5068 instead of 5026.
- **`OrdListAdd`** â€” falls back to basename when a relative path
  double-prefixes the table directory.
- **Trig helper linkage** â€” C++ linkage for `trig_*` helpers to
  silence MSVC C4190.
- **`AdsGetField` crash on SQL backends** â€” reading by field ordinal
  no longer crashes.
- **AdsGetRecordCount on conditional ORDER** â€” counts FOR matches
  correctly. (PR #100)
- **`AdsSetAOF` for non-optimisable filters** â€” now returns
  `AE_INVALID_EXPRESSION` instead of success, so stock rddads
  falls back to client-side filtering. The old behaviour silently
  disabled `SET FILTER` entirely. (Reported by Jonsson / RusSoft
  Ltda.)

### ODBC Driver

- **x86 build** â€” `C4100` (unused parameter) and `C2733`
  (`SQLLEN*` vs `SQLPOINTER` signature mismatch) fixed for 32-bit
  MSVC `/WX`. (PR #119)
- **DM/ADO conformance** â€” descriptor handles, `SQLBindCol`, and
  `BIT` type mapping fixed.
- **`SQL_DRIVER_ODBC_VER` / `SQL_ODBC_VER`** â€” now reported in
  `SQLGetInfo`.

### DA-Web Security

- AOF filter expression sanitisation.
- Drive-root path containment fix.
- API security sweep across all PHP endpoints.
- RI meta index paths contained under DD directory.
- Wire frame size caps to prevent abuse.

### Platform / Build

- **macOS** â€” sign-conversion and unused-function warnings fixed.
- **GCC** â€” `-Werror` warnings resolved (shadow, implicit
  conversion, format-truncation, stringop-truncation).
- **MSVC** â€” x86 `__stdcall` decoration mismatch and x64
  `_wfsopen` crash fixed.
- **Clang** â€” `-Wc2y-extensions` guard for older Apple Clang.
- **POSIX fd-0 collision** â€” file handles are now stored as
  `(fd + 1)` so a real fd 0 (returned by `open()` when stdin is
  closed) is no longer mistaken for the "not open" sentinel.
- **POSIX `EINTR` retry** â€” `pread` / `pwrite` retry on signal
  interruption instead of failing the I/O.
- **POSIX zero-length mmap** â€” `map_readonly` rejects zero-length
  maps instead of calling `mmap` with length 0.

### CDX

- Shared header lock on open so concurrent appends don't fail.
- Structural CDX named per-table, not per-directory session.
- **Stale record-count refresh on the fetch path** â€” a driver
  caches the DBF record count at open; in a multiuser deployment a
  peer append could leave the cache lagging, so an index walk that
  reached a just-appended row (e.g. mid-`REPLACE â€¦ FOR`) failed
  hard with spurious error 5000. `read_record_raw` /
  `write_record_raw` now re-read the on-disk count under a shared
  header lock before declaring a recno out of range (slow path
  only â€” a normal forward scan pays nothing).

### Remote (Wire)

- Use-after-free crash on virtual table queries via TCP
  eliminated.

## v1.8.28 Highlights

### hbnetio Bridge — Virtual File System + RPC Integration

OpenADS can now transparently bridge to harbour hbnetio virtual file
system and RPC capabilities, enabling multi-client concurrent access to
shared files on a remote hbnetio server (e.g. AWS EC2).

Three components in `contrib/hbnetio_bridge/`:

**VFS Adapter** — maps hb_vf*() operations over OpenADS ITransport:

- File open/close/read/write/seek/truncate
- Byte-range locking (exclusive + shared, blocking + non-blocking)
- Directory operations (exists/make/remove)
- File attributes and timestamps
- Hard/symbolic links
- Implements the exact hbnetio 24-byte LE wire protocol

**Distributed Lock Manager** — implements the __isLocked() pattern:

- Automatic .lck file creation and management
- Configurable retry with backoff (mirrors hb_idleSleep(2))
- Session-scoped lock tracking with RAII guards
- Bulk release on session disconnect
- Heartbeat for long-held locks

**RPC Bridge** — maps hbnetio RPC to OpenADS session dispatch:

- netio_FuncExec / netio_ProcExec / netio_ProcExecW
- netio_ProcExists / netio_OpenDataStream / netio_GetData
- Built-in server_version / server_time / server_uptime

Enable: `cmake -DOPENADS_WITH_HBNETIO_BRIDGE=ON ..`

Wire opcodes 0xF0-0xFC (no conflict with existing opcodes).

Full guide: [hbnetio Bridge](../hbnetio-bridge/).
